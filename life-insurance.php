            <p>Life Insurance (sometimes known as Life Assurance) helps provide financial security for people who depend
                on you, should you die.</p>
            <p>Although money can’t replace a loved one, it can help those left behind to weather the financial storm.
                For example, it could pay off the mortgage or provide an income to help cover regular household
                expenditure.</p>

                    <h3 class="center">Types of Life Insurance</h3>
                    <p class="center">There are different types of Life Insurance – the most appropriate type for you will
                        depend on your circumstances. Life Insurance will pay out either a single lump sum
                        (sum insured) or a regular income when you die.</p>

                        <h4>Term Insurance</h4>
                        <p>This is the simplest type of Life Insurance. You choose how long you’re covered for, eg. 20
                            years (the term), and the policy pays out if you die within the agreed term. You can also
                            take out term cover as a couple, with the policy paying out on the first death only during
                            the term. There are several different types of Term policies available, depending on your
                            needs.</p>

                        </div>
                        <h4>Family Income Benefit Insurance</h4>
                        <p>This is essentially the same as Term Insurance, but instead of paying a lump sum when you
                            die, it will pay out a regular income instead. This type of payment may be more suitable
                            where the main purpose of the policy is to provide ongoing financial support to dependents.

                        <h4>Whole of Life Insurance</h4>
                        <p>This pays out a lump sum when you die, whenever that is, as long as you are still paying the
                            premiums.</p>
