            <p>Second charge loans can be secured against residential or Buy to Let properties. They are provided by
                specialist lenders and are generally short-term loans secured against the property, but where the lender
                has a second call on the property if the borrower defaults.</p>
            <p>Second charges tend to be more expensive than ‘firsts’, but can still be the best option for people
                seeking to raise capital – but whose main lender is unwilling to provide further finance, or where
                expensive early redemption charges would be incurred.</p>
