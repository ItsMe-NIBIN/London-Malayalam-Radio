            <p>Buying additional property for the purpose of letting it to earn rental income can be risky and
                complicated since there is no guarantee that house prices will rise nor that rental income will be
                uninterrupted.</p>
            <p>That said, letting a second property to tenants could return respectable financial rewards over the
                longer term, but it’s important to properly consider the risks, as well as rewards, involved in ‘Buy to
                Let’ first.</p>
            <p>When buying a rental property, you will need to decide whether your investment objective is income or
                capital growth. Are you looking to cover the monthly costs and perhaps make a profit to supplement your
                income? Or, are you looking to make a profit later upon the sale of the property, with the assumption
                your property’s value will increase in value over time? The decision may affect the type of property you
                purchase, its location, and also the risk involved since there is no guarantee that property prices will
                rise.</p>
            <p>If you can’t buy the property outright you will need to consider a Buy to Let mortgage. When it comes to
                this type of mortgage there are several differences to be aware of.</p>
            <p>Normally a lender’s decision about whether to offer a mortgage or not, will be based on the rental
                potential of the property as well as your own income, though in some cases, your income may not be
                considered at all.</p>
            <p>Usually, a minimum of 20% to 30% of the property’s value is required as deposit, which is often higher
                than the desposit required for other types of mortgage, and you can expect Buy to Let mortgages to have
                higher interest rates applicable to them. It’s also worth mentioning that you are likely to incur a 3%
                stamp duty charge in addition to existing stamp duty rates when buying a second property whether as a
                home or for the purpose of letting.</p>
            <p>As well as mortgage costs, potential landlords should carefully consider the costs of owning the rental
                property itself. These additional costs may include:</p>
            <h5>Property Maintenance</h5>
            <p>The upkeep of the property itself, such as repairs to appliances, and redecoration that may be required
                before a property can be let to new tenants.</p>
            <h5>Letting Agent Fees</h5>
            <p>Though it varies, letting agents normally charge around 10% of the monthly rental income for managing
                tenants. If you need full management of your property, it is not unusual for these costs to be much
                higher, typically around 15% of monthly rent.</p>
            <h5>Ground Rent/Service Charges</h5>
            <p>These costs only apply to leasehold properties.</p>
            <h5>Legal Insurance</h5>
            <p>Say for example in the event of non-payment of rent, anti-social behaviour or damage to the property.
                Legal insurance can be used to cover costs involved in pursuing eviction</p>
            <h5>Buildings/Contents Insurance</h5>
            <p>The property will need buildings insurance, and any furnishings provided as part of the rental agreement
                will also need to be insured with a suitable contents insurance policy.</p>
            <h5>Furnishings</h5>
            <p>If the property is to be let as furnished then you’ll need to consider the initial cost of providing the
                items needed to furnish the property.</p>
            <h5>Appliance Safety and Inspection</h5>
            <p>
                Certain appliances will need to be regularly inspected and serviced to ensure they are safe to use and
                compliant with current regulations. Examples include Gas Boilers and Gas Fires.
                <br>
                When choosing a letting agent to act on your behalf, it is wise to choose one that is a member of The
                Propertymark.
