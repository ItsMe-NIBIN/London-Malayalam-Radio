            <h3>Accident Protection</h3>
            <p>By predicting the future, we could plan ahead and make life a little bit easier. Unfortunately, we all
                know life isn’t like that.</p>
            <p>Whilst you can try to reduce the chance of being involved in an accident, there is no way of eliminating
                the risk entirely. What would you and your family do if an accident prevented you from working? Worse
                still, how would your family cope financially if this resulted in permanent disability?</p>
            <p>Accident Protection is specifically designed to give you financial protection by providing a cash lump
                sum if you were to suffer from a specified accidental injury.</p>
            <h5>Income Protection</h5>
            <p>Income protection pays out a monthly sum, which is a percentage of your monthly income, if you’re unable
                to work.</p>
            <p>If you suffer an injury or become ill during your working life, an Income Protection policy can help
                protect against loss of income. It can help you keep up with your essential bills and other living costs
                until you’re able to return to work (subject to policy type taken).</p>
            <p>Policies usually have a waiting period before they start paying out, which starts when you become unable
                to work. By choosing a longer period, the lower your premium. In order to choose an appropriate waiting
                period you must find out what state benefits might be available and what your employer would pay you.
            </p>
            <p>The premium you’ll pay will vary depending on your age, health and the level of income you wish to
                protect.</p>
