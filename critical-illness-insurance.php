                Critical Illness Insurance pays out a tax-free lump sum on the diagnosis of certain life-threatening or
                debilitating (but not fatal) conditions including heart attack, stroke, cancer and major organ
                transplants.
                <br>
                This list will vary depending on the insurer, as will the exclusions for making a claim.
            </p>
            <p>Critical Illness Insurance often comes as an optional addition to a Life Insurance policy, but can also
                be purchased on its own.</p>
            <p>Policies usually only pay out once, so they don’t replace your regular income, but you can use the money
                towards medical treatment, your mortgage or anything else you choose.</p>
            <p>Many people buy Critical Illness Insurance when they take on a major commitment, like a mortgage, or
                start a family. However, since we’d all like to have our financial commitments lightened if we were to
                suffer a serious illness or injury, the cover is relevant for most of us at any time.</p>
            <p>If you already have Critical Illness Insurance you should think carefully before you cancel your existing
                policy and take out a new one.</p>
            <p>For example, if you’ve developed any illnesses since you first took out the policy, you may lose some of
                the benefits when you replace it. That’s because pre-existing medical conditions may not be covered by
                the new policy.</p>
