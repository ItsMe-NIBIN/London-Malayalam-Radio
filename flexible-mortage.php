            <p>Flexible mortgages recalculate the outstanding capital and interest (the amount you owe) on a daily
                basis. This allows you to make overpayments when you have money to spare, and see an
                immediate reduction in your loan.</p>
            <p>Some also allow you to make underpayments when finances are tight, which will increase the interest you
                have to pay in the long term.</p>
            <p>They may even allow you to take repayment holidays â€“ a complete break from making payments as long as a
                reserve amount of money is in your account.</p>
            <p>Any unpaid interest will be added to the outstanding mortgage; any overpayment will reduce it. Some
                flexible mortgages have the facility to draw down additional funds, to a pre-agreed limit.</p>
